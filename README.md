# Rogue Legacy Randomizer _Redux_

**Rogue Legacy Randomizer** makes quality of life improvements and adds a spin to the core game mechanics by adding
randomization elements, transforming the rogue-lite into a metroidvania-style randomizer.

**Rogue Legacy Randomizer _Redux_** is a complete rewrite and continuation of the original
[Rogue Legacy Randomizer](https://github.com/RogueLegacyRandomizer) project (which was based on decompiled source) and
is based on the [FNA-fork source-available code](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/RogueLegacy1) for Rogue Legacy by
Cellar Door Games.

This project also works with the [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg) framework to add multi-world randomizer support.
